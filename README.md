# YOLO-for-table-detection
This file contains the code used to build a YOLO (version 4) object detection model to detect tables in images of of PDF pages.The weights of the final model are also uploaded. The image coordinates can then be extracted, converted to PDF coordinates and used to guide libraries like Camelot to accurately locate tables nested within text. The model has mainly been trained on tables nested within text, and may not perform well on large, full page tables.
